**Corset** is a web-based data selection portal that helps you getting relevant data from massive amounts of parallel data. So, if you don't need the whole corpus, but just a suitable subset (indeed, a **cor**(pus sub)**set**, this is what Corset will do for you--and the reason of the name of the tool. 

Here are some highlights of what you will find in Corset: 

**Millions of parallel sentences to explore**
- Dive into parallel corpora performing searches at the speed of light. 
- Search in either source or target sides of corpora. 
- Keep track of your preferred searches and their details.

**Tailored corpora (corsets) from big corpora**

- Get smaller and custom corpora that fit your sample text. 
- Set up the details of your corset (name, topic, languages, size) and launch your search over millions of parallel sentences.

**Monitor and download corsets**

- See the status of your corsets, preview them, download them, remove or share them! 
- Take a look to shared corsets to see if they are already tailored to your needs.
